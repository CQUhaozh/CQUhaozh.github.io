This page is for establishing the project.

### Project 1

This project is the pose estimation experiment. The goal is to estimate 6-DOF pose of object. The estimation process was followed by the model-based matching method in  [OpenCV]: https://opencv.org/. The following shows the model-making process and the estimation result, respectively.

### **Project 2**

This project is for motion planning of manipulator using optimization-based (Gaussian process) method. The [GPMP2]: https://github.com/gtrll/gpmp2 was utilized in this project. The result is presented below.
